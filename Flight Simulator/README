INFORMATION
-----------

* Ensure that you have C++ 11 and Qt version 5.3.1 or above installed before running.

* Included are two folders. The 'rendering' folder contains all code used for rendering the terrain using OpenGL. The 'textures' folder contains all of the images used for both height maps and textures.

* Will not work with non square images.

* Unless you enter all of the commands and arguments to run the code as outlined below I cannot garantee that the program will work. The code may hang or not respond at all if the instructions are not followed exactly. Any problems please contact me.

* There may be some warnings when compiling but these do not effect the running of the code.


COMPILING & RUNNING
-------------------

To compile the code, while in the 'rendering' directory, simply type the following (without the '$' symbol):

        $ qmake -project QT+=opengl CONFIG+=c++11 LIBS+=-lGLU
        $ qmake
        $ make
        $ make clean
        
To run the compiled code, while in the 'rendering' directory, simply execute the code with the following commands and two arguments (without the '$' symbol):

        $ ./rendering PATH/image scale
        
The initial command './rendering' runs the executable. The 'PATH/image' argument is the path to the image file. The 'scale' argument allows you to specify a scaling for the height of the terrain. This was introduced to help fix some terrains being too flat by default and others being too pointy. Below I have supplied some example commands that show off some good scaling and mapping:

        $ ./rendering ../textures/512_2.jpg 20
        $ ./rendering ../textures/2048.png 1
        $ ./rendering ../textures/128.bmp 40
        $ ./rendering ../textures/1024.png 20
        $ ./rendering ../textures/512.jpg 10
        $ ./rendering ../textures/2048_2.png 10
